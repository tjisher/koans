1_000_000 = 1000000

about_asserts
assert_equal > assert

about_nil
nil is a Object

about_objects
!= will not match clones

about_arrays
array[-1,1], [0..2], remember -1 is last element not one in from end
Range (1..3) == (1...4) ie witht 3 dots end value is excluded
pop from end
shift remove first, expensive of course, unshift adds to front

about_array_assignment
first_name, last_name = ["John", "Smith", "Ignored"]
* (or splat) makes [] into argument list for methods
** can be used on Hashes to pass key and value
first_name, = ["John", "Smith"] is valid but I'd still call it insane

about_hashes
{key: "value"} prefered over {:key => "value"} but not mix
hash.fetch(:key) instead of hash[:key] if want exception rather than nil
#todo# style guide says use key: but doesnt comapre  {"f" => 1} != {"f": 1}
Hash.new("value ie for not populated or found keys, 1 single object across all keys")
#todo# review test_default_value_with_block passing hash as default value makes them seperate objects

about_strings
"string" 'string' "\"string\"" %(string) %{string} %!string!
%() etc are multine, auto include \n's, .lines accesible inc .lines.count, length/size includes \n's etc 
<<EOS 
string
EOS  entry starts/line count starts on 2nd line
multi line string concatination "\" can be used with quoted strings
string += second_half is acceptable but "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>" or format('%s <%s>', user.name, user.email) prefered
remember += returns new object
'\n' single quote no specical charaters, usually. + no evaluation ie no '#{string}'
?a single character, use because reasons, used to return int representation
string.split defaults to splitting on space

about_symbols
:symbol == (a = :symbol) ie even when object assigned
Symbol.all_symbols.map { |x| x.to_s } good old map/array/hash to string
lam = lambda  { |a, b| a + b } \n lam.call(1,2)
variable with capital first letter become Constants, which are also symbols
:string == "string".to_sym, can also include spaces because reasons, also :"a #{b} c"
:string.to_s == "string"
.respond_to?(:each_char) check for method

about_regex
/pattern/
return first matched content or nil
after patten can number which group to return ie "Gary" == "Gray, James"[/(\w+), (\w+)/, 1]
$1 $2 etc will remain matched groups until next pattern is performed, ie can use next line
.scan( /pattern/) return array ie find_all
.sub /pattern/ = find_replace, gsub is global version find_replace_all

about_methods
def method_with_defaults(a, b=:default_value)
def stub; end
self. == c#this.
private :my_private_method, same with protected, after method defined or list below declaration as:
private
def my_private_method
self. cannot call private methods because reasons
assert_raise(NoMethodError) do
  klass.private_method
end

about_keyword_arguments
def method_with_keyword_arguments(one: 1, two: 'two') w/ defaults
def method_with_keyword_arguments(one, two: 'two') no default
