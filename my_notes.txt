about_asserts
assert_equal > assert

about_nil
nil is a Object

about_objects
!= will not match clones

about_arrays
array[-1,1], [0..2], remember -1 is last element not one in from end
Range (1..3) == (1...4) ie witht 3 dots end value is excluded
pop from end
shift remove first, expensive of course, unshift adds to front

about_array_assignment
first_name, last_name = ["John", "Smith", "Ignored"]
* (or splat) makes [] into argument list for methods
** can be used on Hashes to pass key and value
first_name, = ["John", "Smith"] is valid but I'd still call it insane
